<h1>Getting Started - After Installation</h1>
<h2>The OSCA Console</h2>
Once you have successfully loaded the OSCA MMC snapin to MMC, you will see something like this:</p>
<img src="intro.png" width="600px" />

<p>In the left-hand pane the OSCA node is displayed - it currently has no CAs defined.  In the right-hand pane is the list of <B>Actions</B> that are available - the only possible Action is to enter <I>Admin Mode</I>.  The central pane is used to display information about certificates and profiles (it will be populated once you have defined a CA).</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<h3>Admin Mode</h3>
The default configuration for OSCA is to define a 'User Mode' and an 'Admin Mode'.  User Mode is used to conduct daily CA operations such as issuing and revoking certificates.  Admin Mode is used for maintenance operations, such as key backups and CA creation.</p>
<p>Entry into admin mode requires a password - this is the password you set during the installaton of the snapin.  You can change this password from within Admin Mode</p>
